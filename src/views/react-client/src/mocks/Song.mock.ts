  lyrics:
    '(VERSE 1)\nHow do I believe?\nHow will I succeed?\nWhen the future is becoming hopeless and me overdosing is the only option I see\nDecreased by vicious disease, the easiest way out was seeming complete\nI see me screaming in the face of defeat\nSeeking tranquillity, give me peace, can I please be released?\nAs I’m separated away from disease\nI was medicated, decaying, I’m weak\nTorn thinking I’m picking petals, they’re all thorns\nI’ve been up and down always elevated away from a smile\nDescending forever into my own frown\nVolatile state of mind, someone please get me out\n\n(CHORUS) [Matt Gelsomino-Novelists]\nIt’s been way too long\nPutting up a fight inside that I know I can barely beat\nI’ve been pushed but I’ve pulled on\nAll of these strings in my heart, I know that they can’t feel me\nTell me why I can’t breathe\nIs it all a facade, is it all my dream?\nI’ve been fighting for far too long\n\n(VERSE 2)\nAs I sat on the sun’s saddle, my heart’s pain rattled the leaves\nDirect into a hundred thousand degrees\nSkin is a repellent, internal I bleed, I concede\nWalking towards my sanctuary, my ankles barely kept up with the travel\nThat my mind is set to carry the concoction of hope and pessimism it had me really worried\nHad me either hoping to die or dying with hope in my heart; pick a side\nLook inside this barrel of empty promises to find something keeping me alive\nI feel my heart reply when I decide to try\nTell me why a journey that seeks the strong sought out me but failed to thrive\nTell me why\n\n(CHORUS)',
